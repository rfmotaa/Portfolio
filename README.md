## 🥅 Main Objective

The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my journey, skills, and projects in a clear and interactive way. Here, you will find information about my key competencies, the technologies I master, and some of the projects I have developed over time.

## 🔨 Development and Technologies Used

The development phase was based on a few key moments. During the mission to create a portfolio, I realized the importance of having a place to track my progress.  

The first step was gathering references. Given my limited experience with design, I started looking for ideas. Then, I moved on to **Figma** to structure the screens, aiming for a cleaner and more visually appealing layout.

Once this step was completed, I proceeded to build the screens using **HTML** and **CSS**, successfully organizing my ideas in a fluid and pleasant way. Finally, after structuring the layout and developing the pages, I focused on the final adjustments to ensure a **responsive and intuitive experience**. I tested the portfolio on different devices and fine-tuned small details to enhance usability.  

Moreover, I added **interactive elements and visual refinements** to make the portfolio more dynamic and professional. This process made me realize the **importance of design and organization** in building a strong digital identity.  

This portfolio is not just a reflection of my progress but also a **starting point for future improvements and new projects**. 🚀
